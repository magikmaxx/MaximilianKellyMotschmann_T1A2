            <p>My name is Max(imilian) and I am a 28 year old student studying at Coder Academy. <br> <br>
            I work part-time for a Philippine company called Goldgate, where we are trying to implement biometrics systems throughout
            various government sectors. Additionally, we are developing an e-wallet that would allow for easier transactions between Filipinos
            who do not currently have a bank account.<br><br>
            Furthermore, I also act as an independant agent for a private jet firm based in Europe.</p>
